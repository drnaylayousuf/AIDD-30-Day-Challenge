# **AI-Driven Development - 30-Day Challenge**

## Task-3

### __PART A — Research Questions:__

 ***Q.  What new improvements were introduced in Gemini 3.0?***

  Ans. Gemini 3.0  main improvements are state-of-the-art reasoning with advanced and dynamic thinking , mastering agentic workflows, autonomous coding, and complex multimodal for complex, multi-step tasks. 

  ***Q.   How does Gemini 3.0 improve coding & automation workflows?***

  Ans.  Gemini 3.0 offers stronger agentic coding and vibe coding performance. It can plan and execute complex software development tasks, generate user interfaces from natural language (vibe coding), and has
  a 1 million-token context window to consume entire codebases for better efficiency.

  ***Q.  How does Gemini 3.0 improve multimodal understanding?***

  Ans.  It achieves multimodal understanding by generating information across text, images, video, audio, and code in a single framework. This enables it to interpret complex inputs like analyzing an X-ray
  alongside a text report.

  ***Q.   Name any two developer tools introduced with Gemini 3.0?***

  Ans.
  
   1.Google Antigravity: A new agentic development platform that acts as a home base for software development, allowing AI agents to plan and execute complex workflows across an editor, terminal, and browser.
  
   2.Gemini CLI: This is a client-side tool that allows the model to propose and execute shell commands as part of agentic workflows for tasks like file manipulation and system operations.
