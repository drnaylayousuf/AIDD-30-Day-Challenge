# **AI-Driven Development — 30-Day Challenge**

**📝  TASK 2**

__Part A — Theory:__

## **1: Nine Pillars Understanding:**

***Q. Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks better for your growth as a system architect?***

Ans. Using AI development agents for repetitive tasks like creating folders, files, configs, or tests saves a lot of time and avoids manual mistakes. This lets me focus more on designing 
systems, planning architecture, and thinking at a higher level. Tools like the Gemini CLI make development much faster work that used to take days can now be done in hours. This also 
increases my confidence because I can focus on the ideas and instructions, while the AI handles the repetitive coding. This helps me grow better as a system architect.

***Q. Explain how the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped Developer?***

Ans. The Nine Pillars of AIDD cover all the important areas needed to build modern AI-driven software. When a developer learns these nine pillars, they gain deep expertise in 2-4 areas while
also becoming skilled in many others. This creates the broad and deep skill set that defines an M-shaped developer.These pillars include things like AI-powered coding, testing, automation, 
integration, and using AI agents. Tools like Gemini CLIs make coding easier and faster, while MCP helps connect different tools and services. By working across many of these areas, a developer
naturally learns multiple skills and domains. This makes it much easier to grow into a strong and well-rounded M-shaped developer.



## **2: Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development:**

***Q. Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?***

Ans. Vibe coding creates problems after 1 week because we not plan and organized anything.

i.   If we work with different team members confusion occurs because everyone has different ideas.

ii.  Errors occurs because we not write proper tests.

iii. If we want to add a new features this make hard because the code is not organized or designed to become extensible.


***Q. How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?***

Ans. Spec-Driven Development prevent the problems af vibe coding by planning and writing the specification before code.

i.    Different and new team members knows what they build due to the specification explain the feature clearly so there is no confusion.

ii.   Tests are written first, so errors are not caught.

iii.  The specification keeps the code oranized,predictable and reliable.Adding new features is easier.


## **3: Architecture Thinking:**


***Q. How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD?***

Ans. AIDD change the role of developers,now they write specification,planning and instruction and act as architech instead of writing code line by line.


 ***Q. Explain why developers must think in layers and systems instead of raw code?***

 Ans. Developers must think in layers instead of raw code,there are 3 layer AI development stack.

 i.    Frontier models that provide intelligence.

 ii.   Al-First IDE the provide the work space.

 iii.  Autonomous agent that handle complex task or orchestration. These layers are separate from each other and can be replaced independently.
