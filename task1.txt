✍ Reflection
Q. What does AI-Driven Development mean to you?

Ans. To me AI-Driven Development means that AI becomes a real partner in the coding process. Instead of spending time writing every line of code or remembering every syntax rule, 
I focus on explaining what i want to build. The AI then generates the code based on my requirements, and my job is to review, refine and guide it. Almost like a director working with a co-creator.
Because of this shift the development process becomes much faster and smoother compared to the traditional way of coding everything manually. In this new era, clear specifications are basically the "new syntax" and the better we communicate our ideas the better the results we get.


Q. How do you see the future of Human–AI Collaboration in software development?

Ans. I believe the future of software development will be shaped by a strong partnership between human and AI. Instead of replacing developers, AI will help them work faster, easier and more efficiently.Developers will explain their ideas and requirement and AI will suggest possible solutions or improvements. Then human will review the AI output , make decisions and guide it with feedback.
Over time, both sides learn from each other AI adapts to human preferences, and humans gain new insights from AI-generated suggestions.This kind of teamwork will make software development more powerful, creative, and productive.
